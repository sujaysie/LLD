The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

---

### **Key Features of Builder Design Pattern**
1. **Separation of Construction and Representation**: The pattern focuses on how an object is constructed, separating it from the final representation.
2. **Step-by-Step Construction**: Allows constructing an object incrementally, ensuring better readability and flexibility.
3. **Immutability**: Often used to create immutable objects.
4. **Fluent Interface**: Many implementations use method chaining for easier readability and configuration.

---

### **When to Use the Builder Pattern?**
- When the object construction process is complex and involves multiple steps.
- When you want to avoid a constructor with too many parameters (commonly known as the "telescoping constructor" problem).
- When you need to create different representations of the same object through different configurations.

---

### **Components of Builder Pattern**
1. **Builder Interface**: Defines the steps to build the object.
2. **Concrete Builder**: Implements the steps defined in the builder interface.
3. **Director** (Optional): Orchestrates the building process.
4. **Product**: The final object constructed by the builder.

### **Implementing Builder Pattern in Java**

#### Example: Building a House

---

#### **Step 1: Define the Product**
```java
public class House {
    private String walls;
    private String roof;
    private String foundation;

    // Private constructor to enforce the use of Builder
    private House(Builder builder) {
        this.walls = builder.walls;
        this.roof = builder.roof;
        this.foundation = builder.foundation;
    }

    // Getters (optional)
    public String getWalls() {
        return walls;
    }

    public String getRoof() {
        return roof;
    }

    public String getFoundation() {
        return foundation;
    }

    // Builder Class
    public static class Builder {
        private String walls;
        private String roof;
        private String foundation;

        // Builder methods for setting components
        public Builder setWalls(String walls) {
            this.walls = walls;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setRoof(String roof) {
            this.roof = roof;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setFoundation(String foundation) {
            this.foundation = foundation;
            return this;
        }

        // Build method to create the final object
        public House build() {
            return new House(this);
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Use the Builder**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the Builder to construct a House
        House house = new House.Builder()
                        .setWalls("Brick Walls")
                        .setRoof("Concrete Roof")
                        .setFoundation("Concrete Foundation")
                        .build();

        System.out.println("House built with:");
        System.out.println("Walls: " + house.getWalls());
        System.out.println("Roof: " + house.getRoof());
        System.out.println("Foundation: " + house.getFoundation());
    }
}
```

### **Advantages of Builder Pattern**
1. **Readable Code**: Easy to understand object construction with clear method calls.
2. **Immutability**: Often results in immutable objects, which are thread-safe.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows different configurations of the same object.
4. **Avoids Telescoping Constructors**: Eliminates the need for constructors with multiple parameters.

---

### **Disadvantages of Builder Pattern**
1. **Increased Code Complexity**: Additional classes and methods might be required.
2. **Overkill for Simple Objects**: Not necessary for simple objects with few attributes.

---

### **Real-World Examples**
- **StringBuilder** in Java: Used to efficiently build and modify strings.
- **Lombok's @Builder Annotation**: Simplifies the implementation of the Builder pattern by auto-generating builder methods.
- **Database Query Builders**: Frameworks like Hibernate use builders for creating complex queries.

---

### **Optional: Using a Director**
The **Director** is an optional component that encapsulates the building process and ensures the steps are executed in a specific order. Hereâ€™s an example:

```java
public class HouseDirector {
    private House.Builder builder;

    public HouseDirector(House.Builder builder) {
        this.builder = builder;
    }

    public House constructLuxuryHouse() {
        return builder.setWalls("Glass Walls")
                      .setRoof("Solar Roof")
                      .setFoundation("Steel Foundation")
                      .build();
    }
}
```

This approach is beneficial when you have predefined configurations or want to reuse construction logic.

The Builder Pattern is particularly useful in designing objects with many optional parameters, ensuring scalability and maintainability in your code.
