In Java, composition and association are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that describe relationships between classes. Here's an explanation of each:

### Association

Association represents a general relationship between two classes. It is a "uses-a" relationship where one class uses or interacts with another class. Association can be further classified into two types:

1. **Unidirectional Association**: In this type, one class is aware of and interacts with another class, but the reverse is not true.
2. **Bidirectional Association**: In this type, both classes are aware of and can interact with each other.

Example:
```java
class Driver {
    private Car car;

    public Driver(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    public void drive() {
        car.start();
    }
}

class Car {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        Driver driver = new Driver(car);
        driver.drive();
    }
}
```

### Composition

Composition is a strong form of association with a "has-a" relationship where one class (the composite) contains and controls the lifecycle of another class (the component). If the composite object is destroyed, the component objects are also destroyed. This implies a strong ownership and dependency between the composite and its components.

Example:
```java
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` contains an instance of `Engine`. The `Car` class controls the lifecycle of the `Engine` instance. If the `Car` object is destroyed, the `Engine` object will also be destroyed.

### Key Differences

- **Association**:
    - It represents a "uses-a" relationship.
    - Can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
    - The lifecycle of the associated objects is independent.

- **Composition**:
    - It represents a "has-a" relationship.
    - Always unidirectional.
    - The lifecycle of the component objects is dependent on the composite object.

Understanding these relationships helps in designing a system with clear and well-defined interactions between different classes, promoting better code organization and maintainability.
