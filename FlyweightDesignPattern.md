The **Flyweight Design Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that reduces memory consumption by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data.

---

### **Key Features of the Flyweight Design Pattern**
1. **Shared Objects**: Reuses already existing objects to minimize memory usage.
2. **Intrinsic State**: Information that is shared and stored in the flyweight object itself.
3. **Extrinsic State**: Information that is unique to each object instance and must be supplied by the client.
4. **Factory for Object Creation**: A Flyweight Factory ensures that shared objects are reused rather than creating new ones.

---

### **When to Use the Flyweight Pattern?**
- When your application creates a large number of similar objects, leading to high memory usage.
- When you can separate shared (intrinsic) state from unique (extrinsic) state.
- When object creation is expensive, and you want to optimize performance.

---

### **Components of the Flyweight Pattern**
1. **Flyweight Interface**: Defines the common interface for shared objects.
2. **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the Flyweight interface and adds the intrinsic state.
3. **Unshared Flyweight**: Represents objects that are not shared (optional).
4. **Flyweight Factory**: Creates and manages flyweight objects, ensuring reuse.
5. **Client**: Uses flyweight objects and provides extrinsic state.

### **Implementing Flyweight Pattern in Java**

#### Example: Text Editor (Characters Sharing Fonts)

---

#### **Step 1: Define the Flyweight Interface**
```java
// Flyweight Interface
public interface Glyph {
    void render(String context);
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Implement the Concrete Flyweight**
```java
// Concrete Flyweight
public class Character implements Glyph {
    private final char symbol; // Intrinsic State

    public Character(char symbol) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }

    @Override
    public void render(String context) {
        System.out.println("Rendering character '" + symbol + "' in context: " + context);
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create the Flyweight Factory**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// Flyweight Factory
public class CharacterFactory {
    private final Map<Character, Glyph> characterMap = new HashMap<>();

    public Glyph getCharacter(char symbol) {
        // Reuse existing character if available
        if (!characterMap.containsKey(symbol)) {
            characterMap.put(symbol, new Character(symbol));
        }
        return characterMap.get(symbol);
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 4: The Client Code**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharacterFactory characterFactory = new CharacterFactory();

        // Reuse shared characters
        Glyph a1 = characterFactory.getCharacter('a');
        Glyph a2 = characterFactory.getCharacter('a');
        Glyph b = characterFactory.getCharacter('b');

        // Render characters with different contexts (Extrinsic State)
        a1.render("Heading");
        a2.render("Paragraph");
        b.render("Footer");

        // Check if shared instances are reused
        System.out.println("Are 'a1' and 'a2' the same instance? " + (a1 == a2));
    }
}
```

---

### **Output**
```
Rendering character 'a' in context: Heading
Rendering character 'a' in context: Paragraph
Rendering character 'b' in context: Footer
Are 'a1' and 'a2' the same instance? true
```

### **Advantages of the Flyweight Pattern**
1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Minimizes the number of objects by sharing common data.
2. **Improved Performance**: Reduces the overhead of creating and managing multiple objects.
3. **Encapsulation**: Separates intrinsic and extrinsic states, promoting cleaner code.

---

### **Disadvantages of the Flyweight Pattern**
1. **Increased Complexity**: Managing intrinsic and extrinsic state can be complex.
2. **Not Always Applicable**: Works best when objects have a lot of shared data.

---

### **Real-World Examples**
1. **Text Editor**:
   - Reuse glyphs (characters) like fonts and styles for rendering text.
2. **Game Development**:
   - Sharing graphical assets (e.g., trees, enemies) in a game map.
3. **Java String Pool**:
   - Java strings use the Flyweight pattern by maintaining a pool of string literals.

The **Flyweight Pattern** is an excellent choice when memory optimization is critical, especially in systems with many similar objects. By reusing shared objects, it reduces redundancy and improves application efficiency.
