In Java's Stream API, `boxed()` and `reduce()` are two powerful methods used for different purposes within stream processing.

### `boxed()`

The `boxed()` method is used to convert a stream of primitive values (like `int`, `long`, `double`) to a stream of their corresponding wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Long`, `Double`). This is useful when you need to work with a stream of objects rather than primitives, as it allows you to use methods that are available to objects but not to primitives.

#### Example:

```java
IntStream intStream = IntStream.range(1, 5); // Primitive int stream: 1, 2, 3, 4
Stream<Integer> boxedStream = intStream.boxed(); // Stream of Integer objects

boxedStream.forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
```

In this example, `IntStream.range(1, 5)` creates a stream of primitive integers from 1 to 4. The `boxed()` method converts this `IntStream` to a `Stream<Integer>`, allowing you to use methods that are specific to objects.

### `reduce()`

The `reduce()` method is a terminal operation that performs a reduction on the elements of a stream using an associative accumulation function. It combines elements of the stream into a single result. There are three forms of the `reduce()` method:

1. **`reduce(BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)`**:
   This form takes a single argument, which is a `BinaryOperator`. It combines two elements of the stream into one. This method returns an `Optional<T>` because the stream might be empty.

2. **`reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)`**:
   This form takes two arguments: an identity value and a `BinaryOperator`. The identity value is the initial value and the default result if the stream is empty. This method returns a value of type `T`.

3. **`reduce(U identity, BiFunction<U, ? super T, U> accumulator, BinaryOperator<U> combiner)`**:
   This form is used for parallel streams. It takes three arguments: an identity value, a `BiFunction` for combining elements, and a `BinaryOperator` for combining the results of the `BiFunction`.

#### Examples:

1. **Simple Reduce with BinaryOperator**:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
   Optional<Integer> sum = numbers.stream()
                                  .reduce((a, b) -> a + b);
   sum.ifPresent(System.out::println); // Output: 10
   ```

   Here, `reduce((a, b) -> a + b)` sums the elements of the stream. The result is wrapped in an `Optional` to handle the case where the stream might be empty.

2. **Reduce with Identity and BinaryOperator**:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
   int sum = numbers.stream()
                    .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
   System.out.println(sum); // Output: 10
   ```

   In this example, `0` is the identity value, which is the starting point for the reduction. The result is not wrapped in an `Optional` since the identity guarantees a result.

3. **Reduce with Parallel Stream**:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
   int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                    .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b, (a, b) -> a + b);
   System.out.println(sum); // Output: 10
   ```

   This example uses a parallel stream. The `reduce` method takes three arguments: the identity value, an accumulator `BiFunction`, and a combiner `BinaryOperator`. The combiner is used to combine the partial results produced by the accumulator function when the stream is processed in parallel.

### Summary

- **`boxed()`**: Converts a stream of primitive values to a stream of their corresponding wrapper objects.
- **`reduce()`**: Performs a reduction on the elements of a stream, combining them into a single result using an associative accumulation function. There are three forms of `reduce()`, allowing for different levels of complexity and parallel processing.

These methods are part of the powerful toolbox provided by Java's Stream API for functional-style data processing.
